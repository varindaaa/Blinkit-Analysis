# Blinkit-Analysis
Analysis of Blinkit sales and customer data using Python and Jupyter Notebook

Overview
This project focuses on analyzing data from Blinkit (formerly Grofers), one of India’s leading quick-commerce grocery delivery platforms. The aim is to understand sales patterns, customer behavior, product demand, and operational efficiency using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques in Python.
Quick-commerce platforms like Blinkit deal with:
Huge volumes of order data (products, prices, ratings, discounts).
Seasonal demand fluctuations.
Category-wise variations in sales performance.
The challenge is to extract insights that can guide business growth strategies, product placement, pricing, and customer satisfaction improvements.

Why EDA with Python?
Python is the most versatile tool for EDA because it combines simplicity, scalability, and a powerful ecosystem of libraries. Unlike R (which is more academic/statistical) or Tableau/Power BI (which are visualization-only), Python covers the entire data workflow — from cleaning and exploration to advanced analytics — all in one place.
Python Libraries (Pandas, NumPy) → efficient data wrangling and transformation.
Matplotlib & Seaborn → clear, customizable, and professional visualizations.
EDA helps answer "what, why, and how" of data:
What does the dataset contain?
Why do certain patterns appear?
How do different factors affect sales?
Visualization makes the insights easy to interpret for decision-makers compared to raw numbers.
